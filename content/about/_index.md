## About me

{{% columns %}}

  I began designing websites at an agency, but with the rise of rich and animated content for the web,
  my interests shifted towards creating interactive experiences with the use of animation.

  Shortly after, I landed an internship at <a href="https://www.lukkien.com" target="_blank">Lukkien</a>
  where I did commercial video-editing, compositing and was able to further strengthen my skills in animation.
    
  I am currently a student at the Hogeschool Utrecht, studying Communication and Media design, focusing
  on User Experience Design.
    
  Thoughts and things I am tinkering on in my spare time can be found on my [blog](https://jasonmiller.nl/blog/).
