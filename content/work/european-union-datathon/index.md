The European Union's datathon focused on using data from their open data portal, the access point to open data produced by the institutions and agencies.

The goal was to address specific policy or societal challenges. I opted to create a database of all meetings held by commissioners and their cabinet members. Currently it is difficult to navigate and gain insights from this data as it exists out of thousands of paginated pages.
