description: Transforming FC Today, the paper magazine for Football Club Utrecht, into an engaging and digital prototype.
intro: |
    Football Club Utrechtâ€™s magazine, FC Today, is handed out to all spectators
    during a football match. It contains information about the teams, current
    match, their sponsors and further background information.
    
    During this class project we were given the task to transform the magazine
    from its paper form into a digital, engaging and interactive magazine.
    
    The completed final product had to be a high-fidelity prototype. David van Valkengoed
    made the design and I worked on the front-end of the prototype.
    
    I had chosen to prototype with JavaScript due to existing libraries covering
    all of our development needs. Libraries such as <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>,
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>,
    <a href="https://greensock.com/tweenlite" target="_blank">TweenLite</a>
    and <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/" target="_blank">Chart.js</a> helped us
    prototype and move forward quickly.

The application had to be mobile, show real-time statistics from the current match being played and the ability to deliver news in an interactive way.
