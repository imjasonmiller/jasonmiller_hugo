description: "Building a Whatsapp quiz by wrapping JavaScript around Whatsapp's React + Redux web application"
intro: | 
  Unfortunately Whatsapp doesn't allow bots, but as it runs on React and Redux, we can make use of the store and dispatcher and wrap some JavaScript around it to build a simple quiz. One downside is that the Whatsapp Web window is required to be open during the quiz.
